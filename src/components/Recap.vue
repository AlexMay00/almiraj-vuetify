Reviving PCs will be very hard. The closer we are to each other, the easier it will be.\n- Inspiration nominations! Inspiration tokens grant advantage.',

Mr. Toggins provides free rides to Almiraj for students who have been newly accepted to the school as Ruby Basilisks.\n\nAfter some awkward introductions over explosive drinks from Bumper Nosedust, the group settled down for dinner with some of their new friends - Topin the dragonborn, Apple the kobold, and Aaron the elf.\n\nAs the rest of the group sleeps soundly, Dahlen is summoned in his dreams by a woman in a birdcage made of thorns. She tells Dahlen and the 19 other people she summoned â€œYou\'ve all earned a fraction of my power, I\'m looking for 5 that deserve all of my power." The Darning Needle continues on toward Almiraj as we sleep, which is where we leave things until next time!',

Dave, Dahlen, and Selmenoch made their way to the bar cart for some morning Malort.\n\nAura-stunning arrows rained down on the Darning Needle as a strange man with a black & white checkered cape and a 20ft extendable wand summoned an army of cartoon-like chicken mounted bunnies. The party managed to defend the sleeping occupants and kill most of the bunnies, however, a few were missed in the chaos. The owlen guard was killed in the cargo train and several crates of pharmaceutical-grade potions were stolen.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, Cosmo was slain in battle.\n\nThe students spend the next hour cleaning up the mess, healing the wounded, and getting their story straight as they wait for the adults to wake up.',

The party talked with Aunt Meltlake, who revealed that she is the most powerful fire mage in all of Manta.\n\nThe train arrived at the nearest stop to Almiraj, where the kids hopped on a carriage driven by a man named Al Mirage. After a long rest on the bigger-on-the-inside carriage, the kids finally made it to the Almiraj School of Amazing Adventurers for the first time.\n\nThe students\' scarabs guided them toward orientation, where they were checked in as new students and sent on their way. Dave led the party toward an omelette station where Chef Dwayne magically produced some fire breakfast. They took their food to go and headed over to an open air atrium where fighting instructor Garmond Kordah was waiting to give his first lesson, a test.\n\n24 students faced off in tournament style 2v2 fights, protected from death by a magic barrier.\n- Dahlen and Selmenoch teamed up and won their match after a lengthy duel.\n- Chipp unleashed a flurry of blows and worked with Aaron to move on to the next round.\n- Sefy and Dashiel were bested by a classic bard trick, and found themselves sleeping through most of their fight. \n- Dave and Sunbeam stuck with their usual game plan (big guy hit, small girl heal) and defeated their challengers.\n\nUp next: 2v2v2. Selmenoch & Dahlen vs Chipp & Aaron vs Dave & Sunbeam.',
