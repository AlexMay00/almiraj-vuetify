Chipp and Aaron worked together to wear down the well-armored Selmenoch, while Dave cowered in the corner and tried to prevent Sunbeam from hurting his new friends. Somehow, Dave\'s "strategy" paid off, as he and Sunny B won the match.\n\nFor the final round, Dashiel and Dahlen encouraged Dave, taking the time to explain some of the nuances of good and evil. Dashiel also inspired Redd slyly, in an effort to get laid. The fight began, and Phelothir immediately put Sunbeam to sleep, as expected. Dave was able to wake her up and the two went on to beat the ever-loving shit out of their opponents. Dave and Sunbeam won the tournament, but their victory may have come with the price of a strained friendship for now.\n\nWith the tournament over, Gormand now had to assess the performance of each student in order to break them out into groups for the remainder of their schooling. In the meantime, Chipp and Dahlen broke away to check out the library, Dashiel and Selmenoch checked out their dormitories, Dave sulked in the coliseum, and Sefy met a fellow horticulturist in the woods surrounding Almiraj. A few hours later, the teams were announced, and our PCs were placed in Ruby Basilisks Team C 36300.\n\nFestivities commence! In the cafeteria, Duane Strauss (the chef, bard, mentor, professor, entertainer extraordinaire) put on a feast and a show for all of the students at Almiraj. Dashiel disguised himself as Duane, and took over entertaining for a time. Dahlen taught the party about the traditional elven green slop being served and Dave did his best to make tacos out of the ingredients.\n\nAfter the party, our adventurers returned to their dorms where a kegger was already underway. 6 scrolls were waiting for the group, which the students realized were their class schedules.

There is a note on the box that says that while they were out, they found this and thought of you. Inside of the box are your favorite cookies, delicious and still warm. Your house is clean, there is nothing to do except put your feet up and relax.\n\n- Dave: (98, Instead of dropping to 0hp, you remain at 1 hp. Once per long rest.)\nFeels too big for the space it is occupying, as if it could burst out of its area at any point. Like pumping air into a glass ball that could explode any minute.\n\n- Sefy: (62, Sense fiend)\nLike being in a grove, green trees above, the sun hitting the perfect spot like beam of light. There is a strong breeze and the smell of wildflowers. A beautiful morning peaking through the trees.\n\n- Chipp: (71, Sense invisibility)\nThat feeling when you\'re staying somewhere new and it feels like you\'re being watched. But also, like you\'re the one doing the watching. A knowing, seeing feeling.\n\n- Selmenoch: (96, Sense Danger, advantage on dex saves against effects in your aura)\nFeels like standing in front of a bonfire on an autumn night. There are people around but they are spread out. You\'re kind of by yourself, and the cold breeze hits you but you\'re still warmed by the fire.\n\nSefy tried to ask Vasa to tell her more about Satyrs, but he swiftly declined. Sefy retreated to the woods for prayer and a good cry. Dave and Selmenoch sparred to pass the time, and Selmenoch realized that Dave, while strong, has awful technique and was quickly defeated. Dahlen signed out a book, a ledger of previous team names, from the library (a.k.a. signed a blood pact). This helped him realize that there is a much larger pact etched onto his soul. Dashiel attempted to set up Dahlen with Mary, but failed. Chipp parkoured around the school for four hours.\nThe party then attended magical items & supplies class where they met Professor Ellen Lozzarr. Chipp and Selmenoch both took jobs helping Ellen with enchantments on Mondays before class.\nAt some point Dahlen pushed his aura into his pendant, at which point a book he had never seen before appeared in his hands. An eldritch blast erupts from the book, and Dave tells Dahlen to practice using the book on him, briefly covering him in fairy fire. Dahlen was later told by Headmaster Claire that this book is his tome book, filled with spells that are currently beyond his comprehension.\nSefy got some new better armor from the Quartermaster Aldo Miraj. The party, after some debate, took a job from the adventurers guild board: "Missing Pet: See Charlie". They traveled into town to try to locate Charlie. They met Calamity Jane, a bartender at The Last Mistake, who pointed them in the right direction.\nCharlie is missing his SPACE HAMSTER Fluffles, and he is willing to pay the group 20gp to return him.

Dave used his first magical item, a plain copper band, while Dahlen showcased his proficiency in defensive spells.

Afterward, Dahlen needed clearance from Mr. Thumb to access certain magic tomes in the library.\n\nDashiel\'s aura sensed secrets, influenced by Duane Strauss\'s ring, which enhanced his appearance. Later, Dahlen impressed Mr. Thumb with his understanding of the library system during his library duty, shelving books until he could access more advanced texts.\n\nSefy visited the church center and met Tolsivar, a Lionen cleric, inadvertently making plans for a future meal.

The class gathered at the edge of the forest alongside the human team, primarily knowing Mary from their group. Fred, a tall, dark-skinned human with gray hair and a rugged appearance, exuded boy scout energy, leading them to "the foot," a giant marble structure possibly part of an ancient king\'s statue base.\n\nDuring the class, Dashiel inquired about space hamsters, but Fred hadn\'t encountered them. He emphasized survival skills both in the wilderness and dungeons.

It was around 7 PM in-game time.\n\nAfterward, Dahlen, Dashiel, and Sefy researched space hamsters. Selmenoch acquired armor from Aldo Miraj\'s armory by trading an item.

Dashiel tried to confront Redd about his recent substance abuse, but decided it was the wrong time. They made out and peed over the ledge together. Dashiel then went to the theater for rehearsal of his play.\n\- Dave met up Carolyn, hoping to spend some one-on-one time together. He found her on the outskirts of the school grounds, fighting a demon that had been summed by one of her party members for fun. Dave watched for a bit, and declined a turn to fight a demon. After realizing Carolyn wasn\'t very interested in spending time with him, Dave cut his losses and left for the theater, catching up with Dashiel along the way.\n- Chipp went to adventiball practice, where she was expertly kicking balls. An aquatic elf named Coral was watching her from the stands, and complimented Chipp once practice was over. The two talked about ducks and how adventiball should be played aquatically.\n- Sefy spent some time baking in the team\'s dorm room.

She spent a few hours tripping in the room, where she had a tea party with six wooden spoons (the tea was perfect).\n- Dahlen crafted purple corsages for each of his dates to the dance.

Dave took the news pretty well, and told Dahlen about his date with Carolyn the day before - though he lied about it going well. Sefy practiced making her tea cakes again, and revealed that she is nervous about them because she wants to impress Tolsivar at their upcoming picnic. Chipp met Aaron for breakfast, who presented her with a finely set table, and huge stack of pancakes. He awkwardly, but romantically, asked Chipp to the dance. Chipp excitedly accepted. Dahlen asked Mary to join him, Apple, and Sunbeam to the dance, but Mary declines as she has already been asked by Peter Cambridge. This provided Dahlen with slight relief from his \'librarians curse\' (of being liked by too many women).\n\nThe party then attended their weekly mentor meetings.\n - Dashiel met with Duane Strauss, who congratulated him on his upcoming play. Strauss gifted Dashiel a hat of costumes, that allows him to change into an illusory set of clothes instantly. Strauss also identified the ring Dashiel found, which is a ring of Sanguine Toxicity - it turns the wearer\'s blood toxic, and allows the user to inflict poison damage on attacks. Dashiel expressed his stress with having to recruit his party members in to his play, since his normal actors are sick with the broom flu. He also asked Strauss for advice on confronting Redd about his substance abuses.\n - As Dave headed to talk to his mentor, Gormand, he passed an envoy of 200 guards, standing at attention in front of an extravagant carriage which donned the king of Aloria\'s symbol. Garmond was perplexed at Dave\'s blacksmith costume and strange accent. Garmond decided to take Dave in to town, where he introduced him to another Al Mirage (Alan), this one an actual blacksmith. Dave spent a few hours learning about smithing, and was offered a job by Al, which he eagerly accepted.\n - Dahlen met with the headmistress, who was arguing with the King. She was refusing to allow him to conscript her students as soldiers in his feud with Dyvesta. After kicking out the king, Headmistress Claire talked to Dahlen about the dance, and helped him make some purple flowers for his dates. She briefly tried to convince him to take on a new patron, but Dahlen refused, he felt curious and determined to learn about the patron that chose him.\n - Sefy met with her mentor Jared, who called her out for appearing nervous. She revealed her struggles with making the perfect teacakes for Tolsivar, so Jared explained that he had written several recipe books (including one rife with illicit substances!) and helped Sefy bake the perfect teacakes. She later took those to Tolsivar, who she asked to the dance over a picnic. Tolsivar said yes and then revealed that he, too, was planning to ask Sefy with an elaborate set of magical snakes that spelled out the question.\n\nAs Fate\'s Needle arrived back at their dorm, they saw Selmenoch packing his bags. He told them he had to leave to take care of some business at home. He wished them luck and left. Dashiel started to become upset that Redd was being distant and hadn\'t asked him to the dance yet. The party comforted him as best they could before heading to the theater for rehearsal. Upon arrival, the theater was dark, and a spotlight lit up Redd who began serenading Dashiel with a song, asking him to the dance. Dashiel agreed and the two danced. When the party arrived back at their dorm, they noticed that their outfits for the dance had been delivered. They each tried them on. The party hung out and discussed all of their upcoming events: the dance, the play, their midterms. Fate\'s needle is very busy, indeed.',

While it did have value, Indari explained that it may be hard to sell due to its negative magical effects.\n - Dahlen spent the majority of the day in the library (shocker) where he finished crafting corsages for his dates. He also spent some time researching "The Steel Spider" - who the King had expressed disapproval being employed by the school. Turns out that Ellen Lozzarr is The Steel Spider, and around 100 years ago she was known most for reaching floor 35 of the great dungeon Bal\'Cin\'Tor. There was also mention of her building machines that violently eviscerated her enemies with ease.\n - Dave spent the day at Alan\'s Armaments, crafting a tiny black dagger as a gift for his date to the dance, Carolyn.\n\nThe following day, the party met with their dates and traveled to the carnival-like first half of the festival. The couples - Dave & Carolyn, Chipp & Aaron, Sefy & Tolsivar, Dashiel & Redd, Dahlen & Sunbeam & Apple - all played games, drank, and ate fair food. In a moment alone, Dave and Sunbeam apologized to each other. Dave then explained Dahlen and Carolyn shared the same mysterious patron, and were both part of the parton\'s death contest. Dave said that he was dating Carolyn to keep her close, and to ensure that she was not trying to kill Dahlen. Naturally, word spread fast, as Sunbeam can\'t keep her mouth shut.\n\nBetween the carnival and the dance, the party had a moment to talk in private. Dahlen opened up about his past to the group. When his mother was killed, and his father went missing, he found a pendant under the floorboards. This pendant is what connected him to his patron, and he remains in the death contest hoping that it will lead him to his father some day.\n\nLater, the party arrived at the dance venue. Structured almost like a three layer cake, the bottom  floor hosted the most people and was the cheapest to attend. The middle floor cost slightly more, 10gp, and was where the majority of students attended. The top floor was very expensive, 1,000gp per person, and was primarily filled with teachers, royalty, and some second year students who had greater means. Carolyn paid for Dave to attend the top floor with her, where she bumped elbows and showed Dave off as her arm candy. After some time, several drinks, and lots of dancing, a group of guards entered the venue and made their way to the top floor. The guards were from Kaedria, a nation located to the far north of Manta. They had an arrest warrant for Carolyn, accusing her of murdering nobles in Kaedria. She was quickly cuffed her and led out of the building. Headmistress Claire and a few other teachers reviewed the warrant and determined that it was in fact legitimate. Dave followed Carolyn outside. Sefy noticed the commotion and notified the rest of the party who ran out to meet them. Just as a druid began to teleport Carolyn and the guards back to Kaedria, Dahlen noticed that the earrings of one of the female guards (a wood elf) bore the same symbol as his pendant. He realized that the guards were taking her to kill her, in order to eliminate her from the death competition of their shared patron. The party spent the rest of the evening discussing what happened, and wondering if they could have done more to help. This was a legal kidnapping, and the party felt helpless to prevent it.\n\nThat night, Dahlen had another dream. He was once again in the body of one of his patron\'s contestants. A black hood over their face, unable to see. A voice called out "Yes, Cyrus. Got another one." and he could feel a blade sliding across his throat. Dahlen awoke, and he realized that another contestant had been killed. Was it Carolyn? The black hood made it hard to know for sure.\n\nThe party sleeps lightly. On one hand, Carolyn was sort of a friend - at the very least she never hurt the party. On the other, she was in the death contest with Dahlen, and it was only a matter of time until she would have had to choose whether to win with Dahlen, or to kill him to gain an advantage. Is she even really dead? Dahlen couldn\'t actually see anything in his dream, so the contestant that was killed could have been anyone. Either way, Carolyn\'s fate seems bleak, and the party has been given a sobering reminder of the stakes in Dahlen\'s quest to earn his mysterious patron\'s favor. OH! ALSO... the party must prepare for opening night of Dashiel\'s play tomorrow - no biggie.',

          text: 'On Sunday morning, Dahlen had a strange dream and entered a trance-like state while reading his warlock tome. Spectral armor formed around his body, which felt ice cold to Dave who was working out nearby.Chipp Dawnglow quickly sought out Headmistress Claire who, upon arriving, arrived, noted the increased cold in the room. She broke Dahlen\'s trance, which allowed him to learn the spell Armor of Agathys. Dahlen then informed the Headmistress about his dream, the potential death of another contestant (possibly Carolyn), and his belief that his father was present, and is connected to him and his patron through the pendant he found under the floorboards at his home.\n\nHeadmistress Claire told Dahlen that she had been unable to locate Carolyn through scrying. She stated that King Logan Cambridge had authorized Carolyn\'s deportation specifically at that time to spite her and speculated that Carolyn was being taken to one of the other major schools located in Kaedria. The Headmistress then requested that Sefy make her tea every Wednesday morning. She questioned the three bunk beds in their room and gave Dahlen another pendant, instructing him to wear it, particularly when off school grounds.\n\nLater that day, Dave, Dahlen, Sefy, and Dashiel performed in Dashiel\'s play, titled "Be Gone Fiora". Among others, attendees included Chipp, Coral, Garmond, Sefy\'s mentor Jared Tora, several members of the Mirage family, and King Logan Cambridge with numerous guards.\n\nAfter the play concluded, as Dashiel bowed, the audience suddenly froze. A noble woman appeared on stage, unfrozen, and claimed Dashiel\'s play had mocked her - Bashaba, the goddess of trickery. She briefly engaged Redd in the audience before approaching Dashiel. She offered him the opportunity to become her "chosen," and when he embraced her, his aura changed. He lost his ability to detect secrets and lies and gained the ability to lie to nearly anyone who did not have a Divine presence, receiving advantage on performance and deception checks at all times.\n\nThe goddess complimented Sefy\'s performance. As a "gift," she touched Sefy\'s scar, making the previously prosthetic scar real, deepening it, and turning her horns jet black. The audience unfroze, unaware of what had happened. Sefy realized her scar was real and left the theater in a panic to commune with her goddess, Ehlonna, at the church mall. Ehlonna told Sefy that she would likely experience another growth spurt and her horns would become bigger.\n\nChipp joined Dave and Dashiel on stage after the play. Dashiel expressed his intention to find Redd. Sefy and Dahlen returned and shared their experiences with the others. \n\nSefy decided she did not want to continue performing or attend the after-party at The Last Mistake. She returned to their dorm. A breeze carrying swirling leaves solidified around Sefy, adding Armor of Fallen Leaves to her inventory. The session concluded with the party being given a serious reminder of the stakes involved in Dahlen\'s quest related to his patron\'s game.',

          text: 'In the wake of Sefy\'s strange injury, Dashiel, Dave, Dahlen, and Chipp went to investigate the altar located within the theater building. As Dashiel touched its door, he heard it unlock and immediately claimed he felt ill, turning pale and trembling before falling into the room (this was a lie). Dahlen roused him, and Dashiel, tearfully, reported that he had lost his aura, though Dave noted it just felt different, like coming home after a day off, but feeling uneasy and unfulfilled. Dashiel claimed he was visited by Bashaba, successfully deceiving the others about the circumstances of his encounter with the Goddess of Trickery. It was confirmed that Dashiel had become Bashaba\'s chosen, but Dashiel convinced the group that this was a blessing, and that he wanted to help Bashaba for noble causes. The group then headed to The Last Mistake for an after-party.\n\nThe story then leaped forward seven weeks. During this time, the party continued their studies at Almiraj. Notably, Sefy\'s curved ram horns began to straighten, and the black coloring from their base spread to cover about a third of each horn. The students recapped their lore research and the magical items they had crafted, also discussing the advancement of their auras. A significant part of this period involved preparing for academic assessments: an oral project presentation followed by a practical testing dungeon.\n\nThe oral presentation was given to a panel consisting of Jared Torah, The Black Thumb, and Summer Armstrong. Grades for the first part of the presentation were primarily As and Bs, with Dashiel and Chipp receiving an A+. Dashiel sensed a pull from Summer\'s aura, while Chipp experienced a negative pull from it. Summer noted her surprise at being a possibility for this type of project, having based her own on Chipp\'s ancestor, Summer Dawnglow. Following breaks and lunch, a second, more strictly graded presentation focusing on their magical artificer items took place. Dave, Dahlen, Sefy, and Dashiel received As or A-s, while Chipp received a C. Dahlen was stunned at his "low" grades, unable to accept the fact that DAVE had even scored higher than him.\n\nWith the academic day concluded, the group had the rest of the day free to prepare for entering a dungeon the next day. Chipp crafted potions for everyone, giving Dashiel two as he was expected to be the first to fall. They attuned to and added their magical items, knowing they would have six hours inside. Flint, Chipp\'s mentor, met them at their dorm to take them to the dungeon. He explained it was manufactured, unconscious students would be teleported out, and reaching 0 HP meant permanent removal from the test, with no revival chances. Their grade depended on their progress and survival skills. They were assigned Dungeon 1 and entered its first room, which was shaped like a d4, featuring large murals of a snake, lion, and crow, each with a single and double doorway.',

          text: 'Fate\'s Needle ventured into the midterm dungeon, a manufactured testing environment in the basement of Almiraj. They began in a d4-shaped main room featuring murals of a snake (traps), lion (battles), and crow (puzzles), each with both single and double doors. It was noted the dungeon had 9 doors in total and 9 empty gem sockets around a spiral staircase, and was based on Shy\'Kil\'Xor in The Magelands.\n\nTheir first attempt was the Crow double door, which didn\'t budge, so they tried the Crow Single Door, which opened into a library-like room. Inside, they found desks piled with notes, rows of dusty bookshelves, and a glass display case containing a hovering blue gem and a talking goblin skull, who introduced himself as Gork. Sefy discovered a handwritten journal that looked like a madman\'s writing, finding the circled password "channel". Dave was able to find the only book in the library that was not covered in dust, and Dahlen was able to read goblin writing which contained the goblin word for channel. Dave attempted to use it, but it only worked after he gave Gork teriyaki jerky, prompting Gork to say the password himself. This allowed Dave to take the crystal, and they returned to the main room to place it in a socket.\n\nNext, they tried a Crow door, which opened into a room resembling a "head museum" filled with 21 human heads, along with a crystal, five glowing lights, and an intercom. Dashiel cleverly used the intercom, pretending to be Gork, and engaged in a conversation about life troubles. Through this interaction, Dashiel (as Gork) was guided on how to identify the "killer" by guessing clues (only 5 attempts!) about their appearance (Caucasian, male, glasses, tie, red hair). Based on these clues, they identified the head "Gino," and Dave used a crowbar to retrieve it from the jar of acid so Chipp could melt it with a torch. Sefy secured the gem, and they managed to leave the room with Dave leaving Gork\'s lifeless skull by the intercom to maintain Dashiel\'s deception.\n\nMoving on, they entered the small Snake room, which appeared to be a wizard\'s workshop. It contained a glass tank with a crystal submerged in black liquid, a desk with large books, a rack of herbs, a pot, and a potion mixing station. Dahlen examined the books, finding information about a cursed crystal and a complex potion recipe, while Sefy and Chipp identified various herbs, noting some seemed healing. They realized they needed to de-curse the crystal using a potion, but the process would take an hour. Given their 6-hour time limit for the entire dungeon, they decided to leave this task for later.\n\nTheir next stop was the small Lion room, anticipating combat. It was a cave, where they used Light spells for vision. They were attacked by two medium-sized bat creatures with beaks. Initiative was rolled. The party dealt consistent damage, but the enemies packed a punch. Dave used his new aura ability for the first time, and absorbed a large blow to Dashiel. Because of this injury, Dave later had to burn his only use of his aura\'s resilience ability, remaining at 1hp instead of falling unconscious and being removed from the test. Dahlen unleashed a huge area of effect spell, casting shatter on every enemy present in the room. Chipp delivered the final blow, burning a hole through the final enemy with her Radiant Sun Bolt. They successfully obtained the gem from this room, but realized just how difficult battles would be in this gold-level dungeon. Having cleared three rooms and figured out a task in a fourth, and with roughly 2 hours of their 6 hours elapsed, the group decided to take a short rest in the potion room while the de-cursing brew prepared. Sefy sat out the rest as it wouldn\'t benefit her health, and Dashiel performed a Song of Rest.',

Sefy drank the potion she brewed (with direction from Chipp), and reached into the cursed water to retrieve the room\'s gem. The potion was brewed perfectly, Sefy was not cursed, and the room was cleared.\n\nThe next room was wide open, aside from a single wall with a pane of glass near the entrance, and the gem sitting on a pedestal across the room. The room was lit with a strong light that caused intense heat and burning to anything that touched it. Dahlen quickly figured out the trick to the room (a hidden light above the entrance) and helped the group devise a plan to retrieve the gem. After building a triangular fort of bookshelves, Dave and Sefy pushed their contraption toward the gem and retrieved it. The trap light lit, but Dahlen had already safely guided everyone out of the entrance and the challenge was completed.\n\nIn the next room, the party battled a statue of a monkey, where they eventually learned they had to use mirrors to reflect its attacks back at it. In the process of uncovering rooms and items from their ice encasements, the party found an unconscious and heavily poisoned student with a crushed scarab. Keeping the student safe quickly became Sefy\'s priority. After the gem was acquired and the room was completed, the party brought the unconscious student into the main area and debated their next move. Sefy and Dahlen wanted to immediately end the mid-term, and return the girl to the school so she could be healed. Dave, Chipp, and Dashiel wanted to attempt one last room (the fight-fight room), to ensure they made it as far as they could for their mid-term. Being outvoted, Sefy and Dahlen joined Dave and Chipp in the fight-fight room, while Dashiel stayed behind to watch the girl and bring her to safety if the party did not succeed. The fight was over quickly, the party lost in only a few rounds. Dashiel carried the student up the stairs to end the test, and she transformed back into who they truly were - Duane Strauss.

After seeing Dave use his aura to help the party during the mid-term, he hoped Summer might be able to similarly help him. Here, Dashiel found out that his new aura is not something that can be changed, since he is now a chosen of Bashaba. Summer revealed that she, too, is a chosen of the god Torm. Summer told Dashiel that when a chosen goes into another God\'s temple, the gods can talk to each other. Bashaba and Torm appeared, and spoke for some time. Afterward, Bashaba followed Dashiel around, and talked to the rest of the party, which rightfully freaked them out a bit.\n\nMeanwhile, Chipp baked a goodberry cake to bring on their adventure. Sefy introduced Dahlen to the peacefulness of the campus garden, where they spent time foraging together and reading. Dashiel practiced his lock-picking, and Dave spent some time with Ellen Lozzarr to build 2 glass bombs.\n\nSefy also visited her mentor, Jared Tora, seeking advice for how to handle situations when she disagrees with the rest of the party. Leaving the injured "student" during the mid-term clearly bothered Sefy, and she needed to process her feelings with Jared.\n\nDave showed the party his ability to easily craft small trinkets and toys during the winterfest season. He crafted a small wooden man, which he gifted to Bashaba. Bashaba imbued the small toy with a soul, and it came to life and hid in their dorm.\n\nDahlen has a dream later that night of a gruff orc man whose party is ambushed, and the orc strangled. Another contestant in his parton\'s game killed?\n\nThey found out that train tickets cost upwards of 1000 gold, so they headed to the stables to try to rent some mounts. First, they checked out Mick\'s Magical Mounts, where they met the goliath owner and biomancer Mick - a real cool dude. He raises mounts that are created through magical genetic modification. Sefy strongly opposed using these mounts, citing their unnatural creation. She also uses this moment of frustration to share her concerns over the parties action in the mid-term, saying that she became an adventurer to help people, and what Dave, Dashiel, and Chipp did in the dungeon was not helping anyone. The party agreed and apologized, and decided to rent normal horses for their travel instead.',
