Chipp and Aaron worked together to wear down the well-armored Selmenoch, while Dave cowered in the corner and tried to prevent Sunbeam from hurting his new friends. Somehow, Dave\'s "strategy" paid off, as he and Sunny B won the match.\n\nFor the final round, Dashiel and Dahlen encouraged Dave, taking the time to explain some of the nuances of good and evil. Dashiel also inspired Redd slyly, in an effort to get laid. The fight began, and Phelothir immediately put Sunbeam to sleep, as expected. Dave was able to wake her up and the two went on to beat the ever-loving shit out of their opponents. Dave and Sunbeam won the tournament, but their victory may have come with the price of a strained friendship for now.\n\nWith the tournament over, Gormand now had to assess the performance of each student in order to break them out into groups for the remainder of their schooling. In the meantime, Chipp and Dahlen broke away to check out the library, Dashiel and Selmenoch checked out their dormitories, Dave sulked in the coliseum, and Sefy met a fellow horticulturist in the woods surrounding Almiraj. A few hours later, the teams were announced, and our PCs were placed in Ruby Basilisks Team C 36300.\n\nFestivities commence! In the cafeteria, Duane Strauss (the chef, bard, mentor, professor, entertainer extraordinaire) put on a feast and a show for all of the students at Almiraj. Dashiel disguised himself as Duane, and took over entertaining for a time. Dahlen taught the party about the traditional elven green slop being served and Dave did his best to make tacos out of the ingredients.\n\nAfter the party, our adventurers returned to their dorms where a kegger was already underway. 6 scrolls were waiting for the group, which the students realized were their class schedules.

There is a note on the box that says that while they were out, they found this and thought of you. Inside of the box are your favorite cookies, delicious and still warm. Your house is clean, there is nothing to do except put your feet up and relax.\n\n- Dave: (98, Instead of dropping to 0hp, you remain at 1 hp. Once per long rest.)\nFeels too big for the space it is occupying, as if it could burst out of its area at any point. Like pumping air into a glass ball that could explode any minute.\n\n- Sefy: (62, Sense fiend)\nLike being in a grove, green trees above, the sun hitting the perfect spot like beam of light. There is a strong breeze and the smell of wildflowers. A beautiful morning peaking through the trees.\n\n- Chipp: (71, Sense invisibility)\nThat feeling when you\'re staying somewhere new and it feels like you\'re being watched. But also, like you\'re the one doing the watching. A knowing, seeing feeling.\n\n- Selmenoch: (96, Sense Danger, advantage on dex saves against effects in your aura)\nFeels like standing in front of a bonfire on an autumn night. There are people around but they are spread out. You\'re kind of by yourself, and the cold breeze hits you but you\'re still warmed by the fire.\n\nSefy tried to ask Vasa to tell her more about Satyrs, but he swiftly declined. Sefy retreated to the woods for prayer and a good cry. Dave and Selmenoch sparred to pass the time, and Selmenoch realized that Dave, while strong, has awful technique and was quickly defeated. Dahlen signed out a book, a ledger of previous team names, from the library (a.k.a. signed a blood pact). This helped him realize that there is a much larger pact etched onto his soul. Dashiel attempted to set up Dahlen with Mary, but failed. Chipp parkoured around the school for four hours.\nThe party then attended magical items & supplies class where they met Professor Ellen Lozzarr. Chipp and Selmenoch both took jobs helping Ellen with enchantments on Mondays before class.\nAt some point Dahlen pushed his aura into his pendant, at which point a book he had never seen before appeared in his hands. An eldritch blast erupts from the book, and Dave tells Dahlen to practice using the book on him, briefly covering him in fairy fire. Dahlen was later told by Headmaster Claire that this book is his tome book, filled with spells that are currently beyond his comprehension.\nSefy got some new better armor from the Quartermaster Aldo Miraj. The party, after some debate, took a job from the adventurers guild board: "Missing Pet: See Charlie". They traveled into town to try to locate Charlie. They met Calamity Jane, a bartender at The Last Mistake, who pointed them in the right direction.\nCharlie is missing his SPACE HAMSTER Fluffles, and he is willing to pay the group 20gp to return him.

Dave used his first magical item, a plain copper band, while Dahlen showcased his proficiency in defensive spells.

Afterward, Dahlen needed clearance from Mr. Thumb to access certain magic tomes in the library.\n\nDashiel\'s aura sensed secrets, influenced by Duane Strauss\'s ring, which enhanced his appearance. Later, Dahlen impressed Mr. Thumb with his understanding of the library system during his library duty, shelving books until he could access more advanced texts.\n\nSefy visited the church center and met Tolsivar, a Lionen cleric, inadvertently making plans for a future meal.

The class gathered at the edge of the forest alongside the human team, primarily knowing Mary from their group. Fred, a tall, dark-skinned human with gray hair and a rugged appearance, exuded boy scout energy, leading them to "the foot," a giant marble structure possibly part of an ancient king\'s statue base.\n\nDuring the class, Dashiel inquired about space hamsters, but Fred hadn\'t encountered them. He emphasized survival skills both in the wilderness and dungeons.

It was around 7 PM in-game time.\n\nAfterward, Dahlen, Dashiel, and Sefy researched space hamsters. Selmenoch acquired armor from Aldo Miraj\'s armory by trading an item.

They wrestled with Topin\'s death, and wondered how many before him had the same fate at this school.\n\nEach member of Fate\'s Needle met with their mentors and attended class. Life goes on, with or without Topin.\n\nDuring Dahlen\'s mentor meeting, he learned that Carolyn wears the same patron symbol. Carolyn, however, claims that her patron is a Kraken - she is keeping secrets from her mentor and classmates. Dahlen spilled the beans to the Headmistress about his dreams and patron. He was also reprimanded for poorly roasting almonds.',

He also spent time working on lock picking with the training locks provided by The Black Thumb - he successfully picked 2 locks (of ten? I think?).\n\nDahlen attempted to research his patron, Sefy obtained a shopping list of items to re-power her scarf (giant spider silk and beast hair), and Chipp spent time honing her adventiball skills. Dave sulked in his room, upset that he misread his friendship with Sunbeam.\n\nOffensive Combat class was a fight between Fate\'s Needle and Beauty and Power. Garmond magically shaped a battle arena with a pond and a 30ft cliff. The fight was a battle royale - a free for all. The teams stuck together initially, but as the fight wore on friendly fire increased. After being repeatedly attacked by Sunbeam, Dave finally snapped and tackled her off of the cliff, screaming at her for not telling him about her feelings, and "killing" them both with the impact of the fall. Sefy and Selmenoch were the final two remaining, and Sel (who refused to hurt his friend) walked outside of the boundary to disqualify himself. Sefy wins!!',

After Aaron awkwardly asked Chipp to have breakfast together, the part broke off to accomplish some personal tasks for the remainder of the day.\n\n- Dashiel tracked down Redd, who was drinking alone on a rooftop. Dashiel tried to confront Redd about his recent substance abuse, but decided it was the wrong time. They made out and peed over the ledge together. Dashiel then went to the theater for rehearsal of his play.\n\- Dave met up Carolyn, hoping to spend some one-on-one time together. He found her on the outskirts of the school grounds, fighting a demon that had been summed by one of her party members for fun. Dave watched for a bit, and declined a turn to fight a demon. After realizing Carolyn wasn\'t very interested in spending time with him, Dave cut his losses and left for the theater, catching up with Dashiel along the way.\n- Chipp went to adventiball practice, where she was expertly kicking balls. An aquatic elf named Coral was watching her from the stands, and complimented Chipp once practice was over. The two talked about ducks and how adventiball should be played aquatically.\n- Sefy spent some time baking in the team\'s dorm room. She tried out a new recipe with the ingredients she had on hand, and accidentally crafted the most psychedelic tea-cakes Manta has ever seen. She spent a few hours tripping in the room, where she had a tea party with six wooden spoons (the tea was perfect).\n- Dahlen crafted purple corsages for each of his dates to the dance. In the library, he learned from The Black Thumb that a few girls were looking for him. The Black Thumb gave Dahlen a tome of invisibility to help avoid them.\n\nTwo actors, Kate and Vererro, came down with the broom flu and are unable to perform on Sunday. Dashiel desperately recruited Dave and (a high as fuuuuck) Sefy to fill in. While searching for costumes, the party found a tiny door that led to a shrine of Bashaba, though it looked like it had not been disturbed in some time. Dashiel also used his secret-finding aura, which revealed a small brass ring hidden in one of the costume\'s pockets. \nAs rehearsal started, Dave felt this was his moment, and had secretly been memorizing the lines anyway. Sefy also did very well during rehearsal, considering how far out in to space she was.\nFate\'s Needle returned to their dorm, where they bantered for a while. Dashiel also cast a spell on Sefy to help her memorize her lines while she slept.',
